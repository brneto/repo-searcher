# My First AngularJS#

***Updated: 2018-01-17***

This app I've made with the goal to learn how to use the basics of AngularJS with WebPack, Babel, Eslint and ES6 Syntax.

## What is AngularJS ##
AngularJS is an open-source framework in JavaScript. It was created and maintained by Google as an alternative to other JavaScript frameworks to make single-page applications easier.

It is an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework so a brief understanding of MVC is suggested, but not required, to use this tutorial.
